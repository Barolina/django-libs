   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to django-libs's documentation!
=======================================

django-libs provides useful tools and helpers that can be used in almost all
Django applications. By putting all these into one central package we hope to
ease our maintenance work across multiple Django projects and to reduce tedious
(and erroneous) copy and paste orgies.

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   testrunner
   factories
   test_mixins
